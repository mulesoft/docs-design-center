The right pane of the text editor in API Designer displays the documentation that is written into API specifications. For API specifications that are written in RAML or OAS 2.0, the the documentation is rendered are identically. However, the documentation for API specifications that are written in OAS 3.0 can include multiple server definitions, as well as links and callbacks.

== Documentation for Definitions of Multiple Servers

OAS 3.0 enables you to define servers by using the `servers` field. You can define servers globally at the top of a specification, locally for endpoints, and locally for methods. Local definitions override the definitions set at the next higher level in the specification's hierarchy. Definitions set locally for methods override definitions set at endpoints and globally.

The following example API specification demonstrates different ways, indicated by ten callouts (1-10), that you can set server definitions. After the example API specification, the documentation for the portion of the API at each callout is illustrated with a screenshot.

1. The Summary page of the documentation for this API lists the four servers that are defined in this `servers` field:
+
image::apid-apic-oas-3-summary.png[]

2. The `/default` endpoint does not override the base `servers` definition at the top of the API. On the Overview page for the endpoint, you can select a server to see the URI for this endpoint at that server:
+
image::apid-apic-oas-3-default.png[]

3. The GET method for the `/default` endpoint also inherits the four servers in the base `servers` definition. On the page for this method, you can select a server to see the URI for this method at that server:
+
image::apid-apic-oas-3-default-get.png[]

4. The `/duplicated` endpoint overrides the base `servers` definition, its local `servers` definition including only the last two servers of the original four. On the Overview page for the endpoint, you can select a server to see the URI for this endpoint at that server:
+
image::apid-apic-oas-3-duplicated.png[]

5. The GET method for the `/duplicated` endpoint inherits the two servers in the local `servers` definition. On the page for this method, you can select a server to see the URI for this method at that server:
+
image::apid-apic-oas-3-duplicated-get.png[]

6. The `/files` endpoint overrides the base `servers` definition, its local `servers` definition including only one server. On the Overview page for this endpoint, there are no servers to choose from, as there were for the previous two endpoints:
+
image::apid-apic-oas-3-files.png[]

7. The GET method for the `/files` endpoint inherits the one server in the local `servers` definition. On the page for thie method, there is no list of servers to choose from:
+
image::apid-apic-oas-3-files-get.png[]

8. The `/ping` endpoint overrides the base `servers` definition, its local `servers` definition including only one server. On the Overview page for this endpoint, there are no servers to choose from:
+
image::apid-apic-oas-3-ping.png[]

9. The `GET` method for the `/ping` endpoint overrides both the base `servers` definition and the `/ping` endpoint's local `servers` definition. The `GET` method's local `servers` definition includes two servers. On the page for this method, you can select a server to see the URI for this method at that server:
+
image::apid-apic-oas-3-ping-get.png[]

10. The POST method for the `/ping` endpoint inherits the one server in the `/ping` endpoint's local `servers` definition. On the Overview page for this endpoint, there is no list of servers to choose from:

== Documentation for Links and Callbacks

OAS 3.0 enables you to define links and callbacks. For an explanation of these features, see the specification for openAPI 3.0 at \https://swagger.io/.

The following example API specification demonstrates how to set links and callbacks. The callouts indicate parts of the API specification that are rendered as documentation in the screenshots that follow.
