Variables are used to store per-event values for use within a flow of a Mule app. The stored data can be any supported data type, such as an object, number, or string. It is also possible to store the current message (using the `message` keyword), the current message payload (using the `payload` keyword) or just the current message attributes (using the `attributes` keyword). You can even use a DataWeave expression as the value. However, the keyword `vars` (for example, `vars.someOtherVar`) is not allowed.

You can create or update variables in these ways:

* Using the Set Variable core component.
* Using a Target Variable from within an operation, such as the Read operation to the File connector or the Store operation to the Database connector.

After creating a variable, you can access and use it within the scope of a Mule flow where you created it, which includes any flows that are joined with it through a Flow Ref component.

* `vars`: Keyword for accessing a variable, for example, through a DataWeave expression in a Mule component, such as the Logger, or from an Input or Output parameter of an operation. If the name of your variable is `myVar`, you can access it like this: `vars.myVar`

Note that a variable in the Mule event is different from variables defined in a DataWeave script, which are local to the script and not accessible outside of it.

== About the Set Variable Component

The Set Variable component is for creating or updating a variable to store values for use within the flow of a Mule app. You can store simple literal values such as strings or messages, message payloads, or attribute objects. For example, you might store the original payload of a message (before it is processed) so you can use it later in the flow or within an error handler.

For more information, see "About Set Variable", which is linked to from the *See also* section at the end of this topic.

When a variable is no longer needed in a flow, you can remove the variable with the Remove Variable component.

== Enhancing Data with Target Parameters

When creating a flow in a Mule app, you might need to store data in a variable so that any component in the flow can use it. Non-void operations (such as the Read operation to the File connector) can store the message data that they return in a variable. Once defined, variables created with the target parameter are available for use within the flow, and you can access them like you access any other variable.

You often define variables through these parameters:

* Target (`target`): Name of the variable in which you want to store message data. Names can only include numbers, characters, and underscores. For example, hyphens are not allowed in the name.
* Target Value (`targetValue`): Value of the data to store in the target variable. By default, the value is the message payload (`payload`). The field accepts any value that a variable accepts: any supported data type, DataWeave expressions, the keywords `payload`, `attributes`, and `message`, but _not_ the keyword `vars`.

It is important to understand that setting a target variable changes the typical course of the message through the flow. Normally, an operation outputs a different message than it receives as input. However, when you set a variable from an operation, the operation outputs to the _next_ component in the flow the same message that it received as input. For example, assume you have a flow consisting of component A, followed by component B with a target value of `myMessage`, and then component C. In this case, component C will receive the same message that B received from A.

In this image, the Read operation of an FTP connector stores its payload in the variable `myVar`:

. The *Output* fields for the target variable are in the *Advanced* section of the component card, as is the case for all components that have these fields.
. The name `myVar` has been specified as the name of the target variable. There is no default name. The target variable stores the payload by default. You need to specify a target value only if you want to store something other than the full payload.

To access the content of `myVar` in another operation in the flow, you would use the expression `myVar.payload`.

For a list of the DataWeave functions that you can use in variable expressions, see "Core" in the DataWeave Function Reference. "Core" is linked to from the *See also* section at the end of this topic.
