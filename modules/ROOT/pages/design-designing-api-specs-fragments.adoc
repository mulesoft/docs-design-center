= Designing API Specs and Fragments

Use API Designer to create, design, test, and publish new API Specifications.

== Design Using the Text or Visual Editor

You can use either xref:design-create-publish-api-raml-editor.adoc[the text editor] or xref:design-create-publish-api-visual-editor.adoc[the Visual Editor] to create API specifications.

With the text editor, you can:

* Design according to best practices with a context-aware shelf that auto-populates with the appropriate methods, resources, parameters, and security components.
* Include RAML API fragments, such as security schemas and data types, from Exchange or write your own.
* Apply rulesets from Exchange to validate the governance conformance of your projects.
* Import existing API specifications.

With the visual editor, you can:

* Create a specification for use cases in which you do not need to include RAML fragments.
* Scaffold a specification that you can complete and customize in the text editor.
