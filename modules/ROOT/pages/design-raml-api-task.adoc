= Example: Create an API Specification with the Code Editor in Design Center
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

This procedure covers how to create a simple API that consumes the free online REST service `JSONPlaceholder`.

== Before you begin

To create and publish an API specification, you must be assigned a role that has the _Design Center Developer_ permission.

== About this task

The API has two resources: `/users` and `/usersbyid`. The API design supports requesting information about all users. It also supports using an HTTP query parameter to request information about a particular user.

In a real-world situation, you design the API to handle responses for all common HTTP status codes: `200`, `400`, `401`, `404`, `405`, `406`, and `415`. For simplicity, in this example you include code only for the HTTP status code `200` for receiving a valid request.


== Procedure

. On the *Projects* page of Design Center, create a project for a new API specification.
.. In Projects, click *Create* and select *API Specification*.
.. In the *New API Specification* dialog, specify a name for your new project. For example, type `placeholder`.
.. Select the option *Start with API Designer*.

+
_Result:_ After you click *Create*, you see that:

* The new `.raml` file `placeholder.raml` is listed and is selected in the Files panel
* These two lines appear in the center panel as the beginning of the API specification:
+
....
#%RAML 1.0
title: placeholder
....
+
* In the third panel, the mocking service is switched off and the API summary is blank.
+

+
When you start a new blank line, the keywords that you can type at the current cursor position appear at the bottom of the panel. You can either click a keyword to add it to the specification or type it. If you don't see the list of keywords, type *CTRL+space*. As you type a keyword, the editor suggests keywords based on the letters that you have typed. Type the *Tab* key to accept a suggestion.

. Version the specification `1.0` by adding the line `version: 1.0`.

. Add the keyword `baseUri` and use the following URI for the value:
`+http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com+`.
+
. Include a resource named `/users`.
.. On the next line of the specification, type `/users:`.
.. Specify a `GET` method to retrieve the information defined in `+http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com+`.

... Add a new line after `/users:`.
... Type a space to indent one level.
... Type *Ctrl+Space* and select `get`.
.. On the next line, indent one level and add a description of the `GET` method. Use this text: `Retrieve a list of all the users`

.. Include the HTTP response 200 and a blank `body` for it.
+
_Result:_ At this point, the API specification looks like this:

+
----
#%RAML 1.0
title: placeholder
version: 1.0
baseUri: http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
/users:
  get:
    description: Retrieve a list of all the users.
    responses:
      200:
        body:
----

. Import a JSON example to include in your API specification.
.. On your file system, create a text-based file named `user-example.json` that contains the following content:
+
----
[{
              "id": 1,
              "name": "Leanne Graham",
              "username": "Bret",
              "email": "Sincere@april.biz",
              "address": {
                "street": "Kulas Light",
                "suite": "Apt. 556",
                "city": "Gwenborough",
                "zipcode": "92998-3874",
                "geo": {
                  "lat": "-37.3159",
                  "lng": "81.1496"
                }
                },
              "phone": "1-770-736-8031 x56442",
              "website": "hildegard.org",
              "company": {
                "name": "Romaguera-Crona",
                "catchPhrase": "Multi-layered client-server neural-net",
                "bs": "harness real-time e-markets"
              }
}]
----
.. In the left panel of your project in Design Center, click the dots to the right of *Files* and select *Import* > *File or ZIP*.
+
image::files-import.png[height=97,width=295]

.. Browse to and import the file `user-example.json`.
+
_Result:_ The file is listed on the left panel.
.. Click the name of your API specification in the left panel and then add the following lines to the specification:
+
----
...
      application/json:
        example: !include user-example.json
----
. Add the following resource by copying it and then pasting it into the editor at the same indentation level as `/users`.
+
----
 /userbyid:
    get:
      description: Get information about a particular user
      queryParameters:
        id:
          description: Specify the id of the user you want to retrieve
          type:        integer
          required:    false
          example: 3
      responses:
        200:
          body:
            application/json:

----

. Add this example response for the GET method by copying it and then pasting it into the editor, so that it is indented under `application/json`.
+
----
              example: |
                [{
                "id": 3,
                "name": "Clementine Bauch",
                "username": "Samantha",
                "email": "Nathan@yesenia.net",
                "address": {
                  "street": "Douglas Extension",
                  "suite": "Suite 847",
                  "city": "McKenziehaven",
                  "zipcode": "59590-4157",
                  "geo": {
                    "lat": "-68.6102",
                    "lng": "-47.0653"
                  }
                },
                "phone": "1-463-123-4447",
                "website": "ramiro.info",
                "company": {
                  "name": "Romaguera-Jacobson",
                  "catchPhrase": "Face to face bifurcated interface",
                  "bs": "e-enable strategic applications"
                } }]
----
+
_Result:_ Your API specification should look identical to the specification in "Example API Specification for the RAML Editor", which you can view from the link in the *See also* section at the end of this topic.
. Simulate a GET request for each resource by using the mocking service.
.. Switch on the mocking service in the top-right corner of the right pane.
+
_Result:_ The mocking service comments out the current base URI and specifies its own temporary base URI.
.. Under *API Summary* in the right pane, expand the `/users` resource and click *GET*.
+
_Result:_ Information about the GET method appears in the right pane.
.. Click *Try It*.
+
_Result:_ The content of the right pane changes to show

* the request URL
* a list of parameters that are required for the method (of which there are none for this GET method)
* a list of the headers for the method (of which there are none, though you can add custom headers).
.. Click *Send*.
+
_Result:_ The response code and example payload for the GET method appear.
.. Click the left arrow at the top of the right pane twice to return to the API summary.
.. Expand the `/userbyid` resource and click *GET* and then click *Try It*.
+
_Result:_ Under the *Parameters* heading, there is a check box to show the optional parameters. The check box is there because the only parameter in the GET method is defined with the setting `required: false`, which makes the parameter optional. You can select the check box and then specify an integer in the text field.
+
[TIP]
====
Suppose that, as you are testing this GET method with the mocking service, you realize that the parameter should not be optional. In the RAML, you turn off the mocking service and change `required: false` to `required: true`.

Before you turn on the mocking service again, type SHIFT+CTRL+R (on Windows) or SHIFT+CMD+R (on Mac) to force your browser to delete its cached version of the page. Then, when you turn on the mocking service and click *Try It*, you will see that the parameter is no longer optional.
In general, when you are testing a method with the mocking service and need to make changes to the method:

. Turn off the mocking service.
. Make the change.
. Type SHIFT+CTRL+R (on Windows) or SHIFT+CMD+R (on Mac).
. Turn the mocking service back on.
====
.. Click *Send*.
+
_Result:_ The response code and example payload for the GET method appear.

== What to do next
Publish your API specification to Exchange. Click the icon that is in the top-right corner of the code editor to open the *Publish API specification to Exchange* dialog. The icon looks like this:
