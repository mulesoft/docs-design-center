You cannot publish an RAML API specification to Anypoint Exchange without going through Design Center. If you want to publish a specification that you have already authored outside of Design Center, you must create an API-specification project in Design Center, import your specification, and then publish to Anypoint Exchange.

== Before you begin

Within Anypoint Platform, you must be assigned the _Design Center Developer_ permission.

== Procedure

. In Anypoint Platform, open Design Center.
. On the Projects page, click *Create* and select *API Specification*.
. In the *New API Specification* dialog, specify a name for the new project, ensure that *Start with API Designer* is selected, and click *Create*.
. In the project, click the three dots to the right of the heading *Files* and select *Import*.
. In the *Import* dialog, select *File or Zip* and select the file from your computer, or select *URL* and specify the URL, if the RAML file is online. Then, click *Import*.
. Delete the RAML file that Design Center created by default. This file has the same name as your project.
. Click the *Publish to Exchange* icon (image:publish-exchange.png[Publish to Exchange icon]).
