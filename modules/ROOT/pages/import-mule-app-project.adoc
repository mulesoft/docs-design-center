You can import a Mule-application project that was exported from Design Center. This feature supports two different scenarios:

* Importing a project that was exported from a different environment within a single organization
* Importing a project that was exported from an environment that is in a different organization

////

* If you plan to import a Mule application that was exported from Anypoint Studio, ensure that, when it was exported, these options were selected:
** In the Export dialog: *Mule* > *Anypoint Studio Project to Mule Deployable Archive (includes Studio metadata)*
** In the Export Mule Project dialog:
*** Select *Attach project sources*.
*** Select *Only export project sources*.
* Studio supports all of the core components that come with Mule Runtime, while Design Center supports a subset. If you want to import a project that was exported from Studio, ensure that the project includes core components from the following list only:
** Choice
** Flow Reference
** For Each
** Logger
** Scheduler
** Set Payload
** Set Variable
** Transform
** Try
////

== Procedure

. On the Project page of Design Center, click the *Create* button and select *Import Application*.
. Specify a name to give to the imported project.
. Browse your filesystem for the `.jar` file that contains the project.
// . Browse your filesystem for the `.jar` file that contains the project. Both Design Center and Studio export Mule-application projects in `.jar` files.
. Click *Import*.

[NOTE]
