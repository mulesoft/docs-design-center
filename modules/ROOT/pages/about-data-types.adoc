Each card in a flow requires input data that is of a certain type, and each card outputs data that is of a certain type. As you build your flows, you should specify the data types that your cards require as inputs and produce as outputs. Doing so helps you plan the flows you create, because you know what data type is required by each card in the flow.

A _data type_ explains to Flow Designer the formats and structures of the data that are in inputs and outputs. Flow Designer supports two categories of data type: simple and custom. See these topics for information about these categories:

* xref:fd-supported-simple-data-types.adoc[Simple Data Types that are Supported in Flow Designer]
* xref:fd-custom-data-types.adoc[Custom Data Types in Flow Designer]

== Procedure

Although there is more than one way to define and use a data type, MuleSoft recommends the method that is used in the tutorial "xref::salesforce-to-twilio.adoc[Create Your First Mule Application with Flow Designer]".

. In the *Project* pane, click the plus sign to the right of the heading *Data Types*.
. Define the data type in the *New Type* dialog.
+
*Result:* The new data type is listed in the *Data Types* section of the *Project* pane.
. Where you need to use the data type in your flow, follow these steps:
+
* To use the data type for the input to a card, open the card, select the *Input* tab at the top of the card, and select the data type from the *Data type* drop-down list.
* To use the data type for the output of a card, open the card, select the *Output* tab at the top of the card, and select the data type from the *Data type* drop-down list.

== Why you need to know the data types used in your flows

When you build a flow, you must be aware of the data types that each card requires as input, and that each card produces as output. The data type of the output of a card might not match the data type of the input that the next card requires. To overcome the problem, you would need to map elements in the data types by using a Transform card.

For example, Figure 1 depicts a simple flow in which each card receives as input data that is in exactly the same data type as the data that the previous card produces as output.

. A process outside of the application triggers the flow by sending data that is in a certain data type.
. Card 1 receives that data and produces its output.
. Card 2 happens to require data in the same data type, so it is able to receive Card 1's output as input. Card 2 produces an output that is in a different data type.
. Fortunately, the next card in the flow can receive that output as its input.

For this flow, you would need to be aware of the data type that is output by Card 1, the required data type for input to Card 2, the data type output by Card 2, and the required data type for the next card. Because each output of a card can be used _as is_ for the input of the next card, you do not have to transform any of the outputs into required inputs.

Figure 2 depicts a flow that requires at least one transformation.

.A slightly less simple flow

. As in Figure 1, a process outside of the application triggers the flow by sending data that is in a certain data type.
. Again, Card 1 receives that data and produces its output.
. However, Card 2 requires its input to use a different data type. Therefore, you must place a Transform card between Card 1 and Card 2. In the Transform card, you must map elements from Card 1's output data type to elements in Card 2's required input data type.
