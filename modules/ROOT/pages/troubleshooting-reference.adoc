|Deployment Failed
|The project couldn't be deployed to the CloudHub worker.

|Not Enough Permissions
|You don't have the required permissions to create applications in CloudHub on the target environment.
|Your user ID must be assigned the roles _Design Center Developer_ and _CloudHub administrator_.

|Not Enough Workers
|There aren’t enough workers in the target environment.
|Contact your Anypoint Platform organization's admin about reassigning resources or acquiring more resources for designing Mule apps.

|Not Ready to Run
|Either your flow is not yet built enough to run, or it contains errors.
|Ensure that you have a trigger for all flows and at least one card after each trigger. Also, ensure that there are no error indicators on the cards.

|Operation Failed
|The Mule runtime failed to process the request (while starting or stopping).
|View the log for your project, which you can do by clicking *Log* in the bottom-left corner of the screen. There should be an error message that indicates the reason for the failure, what to do to resolve the problem, or both.

|Packaging Failed

|Service unavailable
|The status was retrieved by Flow Designer, the response is *503 Service Unavailable*. During planned maintenance, a 503 error is to be expected for a short time.
|Check http://status.mulesoft.com[status.mulesoft.com] to see whether there is any planned maintenance taking place.

|Undeployed
|Your application is not running in CloudHub. The reason might be that your app does not have a workspace in CloudHub, the CloudHub worker has crashed, or someone has stopped the application in Runtime Manager.
|Click *Run* if you want to redeploy your application. (Note: The *Deploy* button actually promotes your application to another environment. The *Run* button runs your application by deploying it to the Design environment.)

|Unknown
|The status was retrieved by Flow Designer, but the response is an unknown worker state.
|Open a support case for Flow Designer. In the support case, include both the name of your project and the name of your application in CloudHub.

|Workspace Creation Failed
|There was an unknown error while creating the worker.
|View the log for your project, which you can do by clicking *Log* in the bottom-left corner of the screen. There should be an error message that indicates the reason for the failure, what to do to resolve the problem, or both. You can also look in the log for Runtime Manager.

In all cases where you cannot resolve an error, open a support case for Flow Designer. In the support case, include the text of any messages that appear on the screen and the text of any error messages that are in the log for your project.
