You can use the API Designer web UI to design API specifications in:

* RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML) version 0.8 or 1.0
* OpenAPI Specification (OAS) version 2.0 or 3.0
* AsyncAPI 2.6 and AsyncAPI 2.0

You can also design API fragments in RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML) version 0.8 or 1.0.

== Add and View Documentation

As you add descriptions in your specifications and fragments, you can view them in auto-generated, interactive documentation in the right pane of the text editor.

== Test Using the Mocking Service

You can use the mocking service for RAML or OAS APIs to:

* Preview API functionality before writing a single line of code.
* Send requests to a specification and receive defined responses.
* Use behavioral headers to simulate different scenarios, such as timeouts and errors.

== Share in Exchange and API Manager

You can publish an API specification to Anypoint Exchange for use in API Manager, or Anypoint Studio. You can also add an API specification directly to API Manager.

== Use Specifications and Fragments Across MuleSoft Products

You can use the specifications and fragments that you design in API Designer with integrated MuleSoft products:

//

//The diagram shows how you can:

//Removed Flow Designer from the text because it is EOL 

* Use API Designer to design API specifications and RAML fragments. 
* Use assets that are hosted in Exchange in your RAML specifications. 
* Publish iterations and final versions of the API specifications to Anypoint Exchange.
* Import specifications that were designed in API Designer into Anypoint Studio and API Manager.  
* Import specifications into Anypoint Studio directly from API Designer.
