= Publishing API Specifications

When you want to share your API specification with other developers, you can publish it to Anypoint Exchange. 

== Before You Begin

It is a good practice to remove unreferenced files before publishing a project to Anypoint Exchange. An unreferenced file is a file that is not referenced either directly or indirectly from the project's root file.

For example, if the file `example.raml` is among the files in a project but the root file of the project does not reference the file with an `!include` tag, the root file doesn't reference the file directly. If none of the files in the chain of references from the root file directly references `example.raml`, `example.raml` is not referenced indirectly from the root file. Therefore, `example.raml` is unreferenced and should probably not be among the files in your project.

== Publish an API Specification

. In API Designer, open the API-specification project that you want to publish.
. Click *Publish* and then click *Publish to Exchange*.

+
<1> *Asset version*: The version number to be displayed in the *Version* section of the page that Anypoint Exchange creates for the project.
<2> *API version*: The version number of the API specification. For a description of this field, see <<api-version>>.
<3> *LifeCycle State*: The lifecycle state of the asset. 
<4> *Business group ID*: The ID of the business unit in Anypoint Platform to which the project belongs. You should keep the value as it is, except in unusual cases.
<5> *Asset name*: The name that Anypoint Exchange uses to identify the published project. You should keep the value as is, except in unusual cases.
<6> *Asset ID*: The ID that Anypoint Exchange uses to identify the published project. You should keep the value as is, except in unusual cases.
+
. After completing the required fields, click *Publish to Exchange*.
+
If your project includes files that are not referenced by the root file either directly or indirectly, a dialog asks you to confirm that you do want to publish the project together with those unreferenced files. By default, API Designer excludes them from the published project in Anypoint Exchange.

NOTE: The *Add to API Manager* field will appear on the publish dialog if you are using the non-crowd version of Anypoint Platform. Select this to add the asset to API Manager while publishing to Exchange. 

[[api-version]]
== API Version

Anypoint Exchange requires that each API specification published to it have a version number, which is called the API version. The content and state of the *API version* field on the publish dialog depends on the following:

* If the specification includes the version, the version is filled in from the specification and you cannot update it on the publish dialog.
* If the specification does not include the version, you must enter the version in the *API version* field.
