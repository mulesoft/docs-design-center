= Common Problems Found in RAML 1.0 API Specifications

[[bookmark-a,Back to the top]]

As of January 10, 2019, the API editor (one of the two editors in Design Center's API Designer) uses stricter validation by default for RAML API-specification projects that were create before this date. If you open in the API editor a published API specification that is written in RAML 1.0, and you see violation (red) or warning (orange) messages, this list might help you to resolve the problems in your RAML.

[IMPORTANT]
====
After a grace period that lasts at least until January 10, 2020, you will not be able to publish API specifications that generate any violation messages.

[.parser\*schema-deprecated#parser\*schema-deprecated]
== Using the `schema` or `schemas` keyword instead of `type` or `types`

The specification for RAML 1.0 replaced the keywords `schema` and `schemas` with `type` and `types`. If you use `schema` or `schemas`, the editor displays one of these warning messages:

----
‘schema' keyword it's deprecated for 1.0 version, should use 'type' instead
----
----
'schemas' keyword it's deprecated for 1.0 version, should use 'types' instead
----

For example, the following API specification generates both warning messages:

----
#%RAML 1.0
title: Incorrect API with schema and schemas

schemas:
 User:
   type: object
   properties:
     firstname: string
     lastname:  string
     age:       number

/users/{id}:
 get:
   responses:
     200:
       body:
         application/json:
           schema: User
----

To resolve the problem, you would replace `schema` and `schemas` with `type` and `types`:

----
#%RAML 1.0
title: Correct API with type and types

types:
 User:
   type: object
   properties:
     firstname: string
     lastname:  string
     age:       number

/users/{id}:
 get:
   responses:
     200:
       body:
         application/json:
           type: User

[.parser\*invalid-type-definition#parser\*invalid-type-definition]
== Using a reserved name for a type

If you use a reserved name as the name of a type, the editor displays this message:
----
‘typeName’ cannot be used to name a custom type
----

Examples of reserved names are `string`, `object`, `integer`, `number`, and `object`. Any name that is used in the RAML specification cannot be used as the name for a type.

For example, this API specification would cause the editor to display the message:

----
#%RAML 1.0

title: Example API Spec

types:
 string:
   type: string
----

To resolve the problem, you would need to use a different name in the type declaration:

----
#%RAML 1.0

title: Example API Spec

types:
 customString:
   type: string
----

[.parser\*named-example-used-inlined-example#parser\*named-example-used-inlined-example]
== Problems with named examples
// APIMF-907

To avoid common problems with referencing a named example with an `!include` tag, follow these two rules:

* In your API specification, use the `examples` facet and only one `!include` tag, as in this example:
+
----
#%RAML 1.0
title: test
types:
 A:
    properties:
       a: string
       b: integer
    examples: !include fragment.raml
----

* In the NamedExample fragment, ensure that each example consists of a name and a value, as in the fragment below that contains one example:
+
----
#%RAML 1.0 NamedExample
myExample:
    a: "b"
    b: 1
----

If you do not follow these rules, you will see the messages that are explained in the next two sections.

=== Not using the "examples" facet when referencing to a named example

If you see this violation message in the API editor, then your API specification is incorrectly referencing a named example by using an `example` facet:

----
Named example fragments must be included in 'examples' facet
----

You must use an `examples` (`example` with an `s`) facet. For example, the following reference to `fragment.raml` generates the warning message:

----
#%RAML 1.0
title: test
types:
  A:
     properties:
        a: string
        b: integer
     example: !include fragment.raml
----

The resolution is merely to add an `s` to the end of the name of the `example` facet:

----
#%RAML 1.0
title: test
types:
  A:
     properties:
        a: string
        b: integer
     examples: !include fragment.raml
----



=== Not naming named examples

When a named example does not have a name, the editor displays this warning message:

----
Invalid fragment body in [[root.location]] , external fragment will be created
----

[NOTE]
===
This is the same warning message that appears when there is more than one example in a NamedExample fragment. See the next section for examples of that problem.
===

The second line in a NamedExample fragment must be a key that is the name given to the example, as shown here:

----
#%RAML 1.0 NamedExample
MyExampleName:
----

The properties of the example then follow after. For example, suppose an API specification defines the following object:

----
user_name:
    type: object
    properties:
        user: string
----

The NamedExample fragment would need to look like this:

----
#%RAML 1.0 NamedExample
MyExampleName:
    user: Lionel
----

Suppose that instead the fragment looked like this:

----
#%RAML 1.0 NamedExample
user: Lionel
----

In this case, `user` is incorrectly parsed as the name and `Lionel` is incorrectly parsed as the example.

In this next example, there are two properties in a single example. However, the warning message appears because there is no name for the example.

----
#%RAML 1.0 NamedExample
  a: "b"
  b: 1
----

If you add the name of the type, then the warning message no longer appears:

----
#%RAML 1.0 NamedExample
Name:
  a: "b"
  b: 1
----

To look at another example, suppose that an API specification defined a more complex object:

----
user_name:
    type: object
    properties:
        user:
            name: string
            lastName: string
----

The named example would need to look like this, again with the name of the example immediately following the fragment's declaration:

----
#%RAML 1.0 NamedExample
MyExampleName:
    user:
        name: Lionel
        lastName: Ma
----

Suppose that instead the named example looked like this:

----
#%RAML 1.0 NamedExample
user:
    name: Lionel
    lastName: Ma
----

The editor would not return the warning message in this case. Instead, it would assume that `user` was the name of the example and that the object had two properties, not one complex property.

Here is another case in which the editor would not return the warning message. If a data type includes a `value` facet and your NamedExample for the type does not include the type's name, the editor assumes that `value` is the name of the type, as in this example:

----
#%RAML 1.0 NamedExample
value:
   a: "b"
   b: 1
----

The editor does not issue a warning message and interprets `value` as the name of the example. However, it is better for you to include the name of the example, so that nobody reading through your API specification and related files gets confused about the type that the example is for.

----
#%RAML 1.0 NamedExample
Name:
  value:
      a: "b"
      b: 1
----


////
//=== Including more than one named example in a single NamedExample fragment

A NamedExample fragment can contain only one example. The following fragment would generate a warning:

----
#%RAML 1.0 NamedExample
Name1:
   a: "b"
   b: 1

Name2:
    a: "h"
    b: 5
----

This is the warning message that you will see:

----
Invalid fragment body in [[root.location]] , external fragment will be created
----

[NOTE]
===
This is the same warning message that appears when the example in a NamedExample fragment is missing a name. See the previous section for examples of that problem.
===

To resolve the problem, you would need to use only one of the examples:
----
#%RAML 1.0 NamedExample
Name1:
   a: "b"
   b: 1
----

A single type declaration in an API specification can use only one `!include` tag in an `examples` facet. Therefore, you cannot split the NamedExample fragment into two NamedExample fragments and use both named examples.




// == Common Error 4
// APIMF-966
// *_Not using a correct value for the `protocols` node_*
//
// The value of the `protocols` node must be an array. The array must be:
//
// * `[http]` or `[HTTP]`
// * `[https]` or `[HTTPS]`
// * `[http, https]` or `[HTTP, HTTPS]`
////

[.parser\*invalid-fragment-ref#parser\*invalid-fragment-ref]
== Appending references with hash symbols to filenames in `!include` statements
// APIMF-834

A filename cannot be followed by a hash symbol and a reference to a location within the named file. In this example, `IncrementType.raml#increment` is not a valid link.

----
#%RAML 1.0 DataType

type: object
properties:
  startValue: integer
  endValue: integer
  exclusiveEndValue: boolean
  range:
    type: array
    items: !include IncrementType.raml#increment

----

If your specification contains an violation of this type, but you meant to write a comment, place an empty space before the "#" symbol. If you meant to reference an element that is in the file, such references are not allowed. References to inner elements are valid only for XSD and JSON schemas.

<<Back to the top>>

== Not correctly using curly braces and brackets in JSON examples
// APIMF-849

There are many ways to misuse curly braces and brackets. This example illustrates one of them. An array of groups of JSON key/value pairs is improperly enclosed in a pair of curly braces.

                }]
              }

          	}
              ]
            }

[.parser\*expected-module#parser\*expected-module]
== Referencing libraries by using the `type` key
// APIMF-1030

As explained in the RAML 1.0 specification, you must apply libraries with the `uses` node:

____
Any number of libraries can be applied by using the OPTIONAL `uses` node ONLY at the root of a ["master"] RAML or RAML fragment file. The value of the `use`s node is a map of key-value pairs. The keys are treated as library names, or namespaces, and the value MUST be the location of a RAML library file, usually an external RAML library fragment document.
____

If you apply a library with a `type` node, the editor displays this message:

----
Libraries must be applied by using 'uses'
----

Therefore, the following example is incorrect, given that the file `financeDetail.raml` is a library.

----
#%RAML 1.0
title: ExampleRAML
...
/claims:
  /{claim-id}:
    patch:
      body:
        application/json:

----

This next example is correct.

----

  lib: financeDetail.raml
/claims:
  /{claim-id}:

[.parser\*example-validation-error#parser\*example-validation-error]
== Problems when validating examples
=== Not including a property in an example
// Originally from "Common Problems in Conforming Either to RAML 0.8 or 1.0", which I'm removing.

If an example is missing a property of the type that it is exemplifying, the editor displays this violation message:

----
should have required property 'property name'
----

For example, the property `age` is missing in the example:

----
#%RAML 1.0
title: Example API Spec

types:
 User:
   type: object
   properties:
     firstName: string
     lastName: string
     age: integer
   example:
     firstName: John
     lastName: Smith
----

Either add the property to the example or, in the type declaration, declare the property as optional.

In this case, the property is added to the example:

----
#%RAML 1.0
title: Example API Spec

types:
 User:
   type: object
   properties:
     firstName: string
     lastName: string
     age: integer
   example:

     age: 49
----

In this case, the property is declared as optional:

=== Using, in an example of a numeric type, an incorrect format for that type, if a format is specified
// APIMF-1070

Examples of numeric types must conform to restrictions specified in the `format` node. In this example of the violation, the format specified for the numeric type `collection` is int8. However, the value of the example is greater than 127.

=== Including undeclared properties in an example when additionalProperties is set to `false`
// Originally from "Common Problems in Conforming Either to RAML 0.8 or 1.0", which I'm removing.

If an example for a type includes one or more properties that were not in the type declaration, the editor displays this message:

----
should NOT have additional properties
----

The editor would display this message for the following API specification:

----
#%RAML 1.0
title: Example API Spec

types:
 User:
   type: object
   additionalProperties: false
   properties:
     firstName: string
     lastName: string
   example:
     firstName: John
     lastName: Smith
     age: 49
----

There are three different methods that you can choose from to resolve the problem:

* Delete the extra property from the example
+
----

 User:
   type: object
   additionalProperties: false

[.parser\*unused-base-uri-parameter#parser\*unused-base-uri-parameter]
== Declaring a URI parameter that is never used
// Originally from "Common Problems in Conforming Either to RAML 0.8 or 1.0", which I'm removing.

If an API specification declares a URI parameter, but then does not use that parameter, the editor displays this warning message:

----
unused uri parameter “parameter”
----

If the parameter is declared as a base URI parameter, but is not used, then this is the warning message:
----
unused base uri parameter “parameter”
----

For example, the following API specification would generate two warning messages:

----
unused uri parameter "unusedParam"
----

----
unused base uri parameter "unusedUriParam"
----

----
#%RAML 1.0
title: test

baseUri: http://param.raml/a/{baseUriParam1}/{nonExists}/{baseUriParam2}

    type: string

/endpoint/{uriParam1}/{nonExistsUri}:
 uriParameters:
   uriParam1:
     type: string
   unusedUriParam:

----

To resolve the warning messages, you would simply need to remove the lines that declare these parameters:

[.parser\*Payload-mediaType-minCount#parser\*Payload-mediaType-minCount]
== Not declaring a media type for a payload
// Originally from "Common Problems in Conforming Either to RAML 0.8 or 1.0", which I'm removing.

If the declaration of a payload does not declare a media type, the editor displays this message:

----
Payload media type is mandatory
----

For example, the editor would display this message for the following API specification:

----
#%RAML 1.0
title: Example API Spec
/media:
 get:
   responses:
     200:
       body:
         type: string
----

There are two methods that you can choose from to resolve the problem:

* Declare the media type locally in the payload declaration.
+
----
#%RAML 1.0
title: Example API Spec
/media:
 get:
   responses:
     200:
       body:
        application/json:

mediaType: application/json

/media:
 get:

----

The following example uses both a global and a local declaration. In this case, the `mediaType` node defines acceptable media types as `application/json` and `application/xml`. The first type, `Person`, returns a body that is in either media type. However, the second type, `Another`, overrides the global declaration with a local one, and returns only a JSON body.

=== Not providing a YAML map when a facet requires one

[.parser\*closed-shape#parser\*closed-shape]
== Using an unsupported property

This error occurs when a facet or data type is defined as having a specific set of properties, yet an API specification defines the facet with a property that is not in that set. The error can also occur if you use an undefined facet.

Example error message
* `Property minimum not supported in a RAML 1.0 stringScalarShape node`, where `minimum` is the name of the unsupported property. A `string` does not have a minimum value.
* `Property invalidfacet not supported in a RAML 0.8 webApi node`, where `invalidfacet` is the name of a facet that is not defined in the RAML specification.

Here are examples that would generate these errors:

== Merging two types incorrectly

This type of error occurs when you try to perform one of these actions:
* Merge a defined type with an undefined type
* Merge two undefined types

The error also occurs when you try to perform a merge with the wrong syntax.

Example error message:: `Resolution error: Incompatible types [class amf.plugins.domain.shapes.models.ScalarShape, class amf.plugins.domain.shapes.models.NodeShape]`

The following example both tries to merge two undefined types and uses incorrect syntax for the merge. The resolution of the error involves defining the types before the merge, and also using a pipe for the merge syntax, not brackets and a comma.

== Declaring an undefined type in a header

This error occurs when a non-existent type is specified in a header. To fix the error, specify a type that is defined in the RAML specification.

Error message:: `Cannot declare unresolved parameter`

In the incorrect example below, the value for the header `myHeader` has a typo. It is specified as `someTypo`, not as `someType`.

== Specifying values for an enum that does not match the enum's data type
// APIMF-1062

Because of the editor's strict parsing according to the YAML specification, it does not automatically cast values to declared data types. To illustrate the violation, here is an invalid declaration of an enum:

----
type: string
enum: [1,2,3]
----

The data type for the enum is `string`; however, the values are all integers. Because the editor stricly parses according to the YAML specification, it does not cast the integers to `string` values automatically. Therefore, either the type is declared incorrectly in this example and should be `integer`, or the enum values need to be in quotation marks.

Here is another invalid declaration:

----
type: string
enum: [
        "a",
        "b",
        "c",
        false,
        3.0
      ]
----

The value `false` is a `boolean`, while the value `3.0` is a `float`. Neither is converted to a `string` value by the editor.

The next three declarations are valid.
----
type: string
enum: ["1","2","3"]
----

----
type: integer
enum: [1,2,3]
----

----
type: string
enum: [
        "a",
        "b",
        "c",
        "false",
        "3.0"
      ]
----

[NOTE]
====
This violation can occur not just in enums, but also anywhere an `integer`, `nil` value, or value of some other data type is introduced where the parser expects a `string` value.
