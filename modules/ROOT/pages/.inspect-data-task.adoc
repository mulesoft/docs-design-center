= To Inspect Input and Output (Flow Designer)
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

In this procedure, you inspect input and output payloads and attributes from the procedures you performed earlier to create a basic Mule app and to add an expression to make dynamic requests. You can also inspect variables and errors.

Input and output data is lost by any one of the following actions:

* Reloading the Design Center browser
* Making changes to a running app
* Closing and opening a Design Center project

If you lost input and output data due to reloading the browser, you do not have to rerun the app. Just execute the flow to start the data flowing into the app. If you lost input and output data due to making changes to the app or closing and opening the project, rerun the app and re-exeute the flow as described in this procedure.

. Click Run.
. Re-execute the flow:
* When the app is running, click options image:run-app-design-env-design-center-2428b.png[].
* Click Copy Link.
* Paste the link in a browser or client, and type */getpath?path=users* at the end.
+
The HTTP Listener hears the request, and starts the app. The JSON Placeholder profile of each user appears in the browser. The green status indicator appears in all parts of the flow.
+
. Open HTTP Request in myproject.
. In Input, in Show, select Attributes.
. In History, select an execution time. Attributes appear. For example:
